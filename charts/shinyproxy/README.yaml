# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a helm chart for the awesome [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/).

  ShinyProxy adds Authentication and Load Balancing to RShiny, Dash and Flask Apps.

  ## Parameters


  ## Credits and Thanks

  Open source software is not built in a vacuum!

  [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/) backs this helm chart. It's a great piece of software to add authentication and load balancing to any RShiny, Dash, or Flask web application.
  [Zero to ShinyProxy](https://github.com/remche/zero-to-shinyproxy) is another ShinyProxy helm chart that this chart uses as a base.
  [CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse) is a devops accelerator that has tons of great recipes and build tools that all devs should take advantage.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-

  - Cloud Native - Deploy your RShiny, Dash, and Flask apps to AWS in what I think is the least painful way possible.
  - Authentication - enabled through [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/) in the hosted version.
  - Load Balancing - We're doing data science over here. We don't want big computers hanging out burning money when we're not even using them.
  - Open source - Nothing is hidden behind a paywall.
  - Self hosted using the DIY approach with the Helm Charts
  - Hosted option with the AWS Marketplace (Coming Soon!).

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
