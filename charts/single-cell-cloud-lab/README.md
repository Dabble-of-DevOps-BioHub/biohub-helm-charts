## Credits and Thanks

Open source software is not built in a vacuum!

[ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/) backs this helm chart. It's a great piece of software to add authentication and load balancing to any RShiny, Dash, or Flask web application.
[Zero to ShinyProxy](https://github.com/remche/zero-to-shinyproxy) is another ShinyProxy helm chart that this chart uses as a base.
[CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse) is a devops accelerator that has tons of great recipes and build tools that all devs should take advantage.

This project is part of the ["BioAnalyze"](https://www.dabbleofdevops.com/biohub) project, which aims to make High Performance Compute Architecture accessible to everyone.

## Data Science Infrastructure on AWS

![BioAnalyze Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dabble-of-devops-bioanalyze/biohub-info/master/images/BioAnalyze-Ecosystem-Data-Visualization.jpeg)




## Introduction


- Cloud Native - View your Single Cell data stored on S3 in a browser.
- Authentication - enabled through [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/) in the hosted version.
- Load Balancing - We're doing data science over here. We don't want big computers hanging out burning money when we're not even using them.
- Open source - Nothing is hidden behind a paywall.
- Self hosted using the DIY approach with the Helm Charts
- Hosted option with the AWS Marketplace (Coming Soon!).




## ✨ Quick Start Self Hosted with `Helm`

> Install the Helm Chart

  ```bash
  helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
  helm repo add bioanalyze https://dabble-of-devops-bioanalyze.github.io/helm-charts/
  helm repo update
  helm upgrade --install \
    my-awesome-app \
    bioanalyze/shinyproxy \
    --values path-to-my/values.yaml
  ```

## ✨ Quick Start  - AWS Marketplace

Coming Soon!## Quick Start

The `Makefile` is always the source of truth in any BioAnalyze project.

  ```
  helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
  helm repo add bioanalyze https://dabble-of-devops-bioanalyze.github.io/helm-charts/
  helm repo update
  helm upgrade --install \
    my-awesome-app \
    bioanalyze/shinyproxy \
    --values path-to-my/values.yaml
  ```


## Examples


## Access data in S3

*Please note that this will give read and write access to an S3 Bucket and should only used in trusted environments.*

In order to access data in S3 you need to create an IAM role policy and associate it with a K8s service account.

[Full Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-service-account-iam-policy-and-role.html)

Change the value from `MY-S3-BUCKET` to your bucket.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::MY-S3-BUCKET"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*Object",
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::MY-S3-BUCKET/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Save this to `MY-S3-BUCKET-rw-policy.json`

```
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name MY-S3-BUCKET-rw-policy \
  --policy-document MY-S3-BUCKET-rw-policy.json
````

The ARN should come up when you create the role, but if you miss it you can search for it.

```
aws iam list-policies | jq -r '.Policies[] | select(.PolicyName|match("MY-S3-BUCKET-rw-policy")) | .Arn'
```

Then create the K8s service account using `eksctl`

```
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
    --name MY-S3-BUCKET-rw \
    --namespace default \
    --region MY-REGION \
    --cluster MY-CLUSTER \
    --attach-policy-arn ABOVE-ARN \
    --approve \
    --override-existing-serviceaccounts
```

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dabble-of-devops-bioanalyze/helm-charts/issues) to report any bugs or file feature requests.

### Developing

If you are interested in being a contributor and want to get involved in developing this project or help out with other projects, I would love to hear from you! Shoot me an email at jillian@dabbleofdevops.com.

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes

#### Developer Notes

The `README.md` is created using the standard [CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-example-module) template that has been modified to use BioAnalyze information and URLs, and other documentation is generated using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Terraform code does not render properly when using the `literalinclude` directive, so instead we use `pygmentize` to render it to html which is included directly.

```
.. raw:: html
   :file: ./_html/main.tf.html
```

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest changes from "upstream" before making a pull request!
